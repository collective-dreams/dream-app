# Dream App - Browser Testing Setup with Playwright MCP and Visual Regression

## RESTART CONTEXT - EVERYTHING IS SET UP! ðŸŽ‰

### What We Built
Successfully created a complete browser automation testing setup with visual regression capabilities:
- **Playwright** for browser automation (clicking, typing, navigating)
- **Argos CI** for visual regression (screenshot comparison)
- **MCP Integration** for AI-powered test creation

### Completed Setup âœ…
1. **Project Structure Created**:
   ```
   dream-app/
   â”œâ”€â”€ tests/example-visual.spec.ts    # Example tests with screenshots
   â”œâ”€â”€ playwright.config.ts            # Full Playwright + Argos config
   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json                    # Scripts configured
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                       # User documentation
   â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md                       # This file
   â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                      # Proper ignores
   ```

2. **Dependencies Installed**:
   - @playwright/test
   - playwright  
   - @argos-ci/playwright
   - All Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - @upstash/context7-mcp (globally)

3. **MCP Servers Configured** in `~/.claude_code/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "context7": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@upstash/context7-mcp"]
       },
       "playwright": {
         "command": "npx", 
         "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Test Scripts Ready** in package.json:
   ```bash
   npm test          # Run all tests
   npm run test:ui   # Interactive UI mode
   npm run test:headed # See browser while testing
   npm run test:debug  # Debug mode
   npm run test:report # View HTML report
   ```

### How It Works
- **Automated Testing**: Playwright clicks through pages, fills forms, navigates
- **Visual Testing**: argosScreenshot() captures screenshots at key points
- **Regression Detection**: Argos CI compares screenshots to detect UI changes
- **MCP Integration**: Natural language commands for browser automation

### Example Test Features (in tests/example-visual.spec.ts)
- Full page screenshots
- Element-specific screenshots  
- Responsive design testing (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Interactive element testing
- Form interaction with visual verification

### User's Goal Achieved âœ…
User wanted: "clicking through doing [actions] but also the screenshot aspect"
We delivered: Automated browser interactions + screenshot capture + visual regression

### Next Steps After Restart
1. Run `npm test` to see the tests in action
2. Use MCP commands to create new tests via natural language
3. Set up Argos CI account for cloud-based visual regression

### Important Notes
- MCP servers should be available after Claude Code restart
- All dependencies are installed and ready
- Tests work with real websites (example.com, playwright.dev)
- Visual regression compares screenshots automatically
